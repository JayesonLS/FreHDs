Unmodified copy of Frederic Vecoven's 2.14 file release for
easy reference.

------------------

Frederic Vecoven's original schematic transcribed into KiCard to 
use as a starting point for derivative projects. A PCB layout has 
also been created using the original gerbers. Note however that
this was used for checking the correctness of the schematic and is
not intended for production. Some of the footprints and clearances
are very rough and should be corrected / cleaned up before attempting
to produce boards. Just use the original gerbers instead.

_Derivative projects may follow, time permitting._
